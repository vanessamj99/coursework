#a
#y = 105.36 + 0.67 * shoulder_girth
#b
#The intercept is when someone with a shoulder girth of 0 will be predicted
#to have a height of 105.36
#The slope is that for every 1 cm that the shoulder girth increases, there is a height increase of .67
#c
#R^2 is about 45%. About 45% of variation in height is represented in the model.
#d
#166.06
#e
#residual = 160 -166.06 = -6.06
#f

#a The relationship is linear and positive
#b weight = -105.0113 + 1.0176 * height
#c The true slope coefficient of the height is 0.
